This is a simple demo project to show a Domain Driven Design with Kotlin.

## Run it

```
./gradlew bootRun
```

Then simulate an incoming event:

```
POST to http://localhost:8080/master_data_update
POST to http://localhost:8080/media_data_update
```

## Example Use Case

The subject of this demo is the `Product Service`.
The `Product Service` is located between five other components.
The `Master Data Service` will push new products to the `Product Service`.
This is the beginning of our business process.
The `Product Service` will register each new product at the `Media Data Service`.
After a product is registered, the `Product Service` will receive updates for this product from the `Media Data Service`. 
After an update was received, the `Product Service` will:
 - Update the `CDN` if media data has changed
 - Update the `Shop` and `search index` if master data has changed

```

                                            ▼         ▼          ▼
                                         +-----+  +------+  +--------+ 
                                         | CDN |  | Shop |  | Search |
                                         +-----+  +------+  +--------+
```

## What to see

- A domain entity called `Product.kt` which encapsulates business logic and throws domain events.
- A process flow with events ("something has happened") and commands ("now do something").
- Value objects such as `ProductNumber.kt` or `ProductInformation.kt`.
- A ports-and-adapters package layout.
- An anti-corruption layer for external events - they will be transformed to internal commands.
